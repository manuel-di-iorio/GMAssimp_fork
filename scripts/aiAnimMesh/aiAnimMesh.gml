/** An AnimMesh is an attachment to an #aiMesh stores per-vertex
 *  animations for a particular frame.
 *
 *  You may think of an #aiAnimMesh as a `patch` for the host mesh, which
 *  replaces only certain vertex data streams at a particular time.
 *  Each mesh stores n attached attached meshes (#aiMesh::mAnimMeshes).
 *  The actual relationship between the time line and anim meshes is
 *  established by #aiMeshAnim, which references singular mesh attachments
 *  by their ID and binds them to a time offset.
